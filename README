# react-ts-node-typescript

Hi there!

I hope you are doing well. In this project, you can find a software solution to pretend a streaming to allow students watch a video and besides interact each other through a chat.

For the backend, I used Node.js and Express, on the other hand for the frontend, I used React and Redux. As a developer always looking to improve the code quality, I have integrated TypeScript and ESLint as well.

##Demo

## Features
- Sing up form: To access the dashboard is necessary fill out the form and submit the information.
- Sing in: Once you are registered correctly, go to login and fill out the form, next press login button
- Display streaming: When the dashboard is ready, let's play the video to pretend a real streaming
- Chat: To finish, let's prove the chat ... typing text as you want it
